# AttendanceScript

This is an automated emailing script for the Lambda Gamma Chapter of Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity. Implemented in Google Colab and Google Sheets, this scans the absent members at required meetings from the spreadsheet and sends them an email notifying them of their absence and any potential fines associated.
