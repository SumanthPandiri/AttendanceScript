# AttendanceScript

This is an automated emailing script for the Lambda Gamma Chapter of Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity. Implemented in Google Colab and Google Sheets, this scans the absetn members at required meetings and sends them an email notifying them of their absence and any potential fines associated.
